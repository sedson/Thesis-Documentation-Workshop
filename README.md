## 1 – Managing Files

Organizing your files will make things go smoother. You can do this with either Finder or Adobe Bridge, but Bridge is faster. The goal here is to have build a folder structure something like this:

```
📁 Thesis_Documentation
├── 📁 Source
    ├── 📷 DSCF0738.RAF
    ├── 📷 IMG_7435.CR2
    ...

└── 📁 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_Raw
    ├── 📷 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_01.RAF
    ...
    ├── 📷 2021_GrapicDesign_Edson_10.dng

└── 📁 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_Processed
    ├── 🖼️ 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_01.jpg
    ...
    ├── 🖼️ 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_10.jpg
```
