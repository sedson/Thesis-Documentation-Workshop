## Overview

1. Managing files with Finder or Bridge
1. Basic Editing and Color Correcting in Photoshop
1. Resizing and Exporting from Photoshop


## 1 – Managing Files

Organizing your files will make things go smoother. You can do this with either Finder or Adobe Bridge, but Bridge is faster. The goal here is to have build a folder structure something like this:

```
📁 Thesis_Documentation
├── 📁 Source
    ├── 📷 DSCF0738.RAF
    ├── 📷 IMG_7435.CR2
    ...

└── 📁 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_Raw
    ├── 📷 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_01.RAF
    ...
    ├── 📷 2021_GrapicDesign_Edson_10.dng

└── 📁 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_Processed
    ├── 🖼️ 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_01.jpg
    ...
    ├── 🖼️ 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_10.jpg

└── 📁 Working_Files
    ├── 🖼️ 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_01.psd
    ...
    ├── 🖼️ 2021_GraphicDesign_Edson_10.psd
```

### With Adobe Bridge

1. Gather all your raw photos in a single place (on a memory card or external drive if working on a lab machine). I wish had made (at least) two copies of this drive! I put all my thesis photos on one memory card which I lost on move out day – so about half of my orignal photo files are gone.
1. Create a folder for your raw selects and for your edited selects
1. Open Adobe Bridge and navigate to your working location – ex: `Computer > MemoryCard > Thesis > Photos`
  - Make sure you are in the `Essentials` works space (top center)
1. Drag this folder onto the `Favorites` area so you can access it quickly
1. Find the `Collections` tab (middle left) and right click to create a new collection
1. Add photos to your collection with drag and drop
1. Can play around with using the star ratings and filters to narrow down photos
1. Once you have the 10ish photos in your collection you have 2 options to export:
  - find the `Exports` tab and `Create a New Preset` with these setings :
  ![export settings](screenshots/export_settings.png)
  - Create a new
