## 1 – Managing Files

The goal here is to have build a folder structure something like this:

```
📁 Thesis_Documentation
├── 📁 Source
    ├── 📷 DSCF0738.RAF
    ├── 📷 IMG_7435.CR2
    ...

└── 📁 2021_Edson_GraphicDesign_Raw
    ├── 📷 2021_Edson_GraphicDesign_01.RAF
    ...
    ├── 📷 2021_Edson_GrapicDesign_10.NEF

└── 📁 2021_Edson_GraphicDesign_Edited
    ├── 🖼️ 2021_Edson_GraphicDesign_01.jpg
    ...
    ├── 🖼️ 2021_Edson_GraphicDesign_10.jpg
